# kw
JSON + shared libraries = your c++ execution salad... 

This project is currently a work in progress.

# Purpose
For prototyping IoT applications, it is often needed to do some event 
processing with timers or other event sources. To enable developers to get fast into the job of 
the focussed sensor implementations, this library was created.
Furthermore the lib offers the possibility to configure applications via JSON configs and load 
parts of the application from shared libraries, to get more flexibility.
